      As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more.
      <span class="underline">I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.</span>
      <span class="highlighted">It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>
      In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead,
      his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:
      <span class="red-text">"What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</span>
      As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a half-smile, I said to myself, again:
      <span class="red-text">"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower--the image
        of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is sleep..."</span> And I felt him
      to be more fragile still. <span class="underline">felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished
      by a little puff of wind...</span>
